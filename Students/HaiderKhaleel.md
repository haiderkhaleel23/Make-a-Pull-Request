Hi there,

My name is Haider Khaleel and I am an Electrical Engineering Graduate but my passion lies in Entrepreneurship and Digital Marketing. At present, I am working as a Freelancer, a Digital Marketer and am running an e-commerce store as well.

Moreover, I have great interest in programming and technology. I like interacting and communicating with new people and sharing ideas. Currently, I am participating in Hactober Fest 2018 and for that, I am making a Pull Request.

Well, if you need to contact me, you can find me at:
